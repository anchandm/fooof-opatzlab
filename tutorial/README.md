# FOOOF Tutorials Index

The FOOOF tutorials are spread out across a series of notebooks, which are ordered to take you through understanding and working with FOOOF. Each tutorial aims to be short and to the point about a particular aspect of idea and module.

If you want to skip right to the quickest, most hands-on tutorial to get started, try [02-FOOOF](02-FOOOF.ipynb).

- [01-Model Description](01-ModelDescription.ipynb)
